# Wasserstein GANs: Research Analysis & Insights

This repository presents a **mini research project on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs)**, conducted through an in-depth review of foundational and contemporary research papers combined with experimental evaluation and analytical insights.

The study focuses on understanding **training instability in traditional GANs** and how the **Wasserstein distance formulation** improves convergence, gradient behavior, and generative performance.
